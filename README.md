# browser-automation-selenium
A collection of Python automation projects using Selenium for messaging apps, games, and web interactions.

##  WhatsApp & Instagram Message Automation

Currently this project includes two automation scripts with the same functionality:

- <img src="https://img.icons8.com/fluency/48/000000/instagram-new.png" width="20"/> **Instagram Auto Messenger**

Both tools let you send the same message multiple times to a friend.
Whether you want to greet your friends repeatedly, send reminders, or even playfully annoy someone, this tool has you covered! 😄😉
